Description: Advanced network path discovery and diagnostic tool
 autopath-xv is a high-performance network traceroute utility designed 
 for sub-second path discovery. It bridges the gap between Layer 3 
 routing and Layer 2 link-layer analysis, supporting:
 .
  * Sub-600ms network-latency-bound execution.
  * Intelligent Path Auditing (Shotgun interface discovery).
  * Layer 2 MAC address resolution per hop.
  * Professional path breakdown and routing loop diagnostics.
  * Advanced Smart Mode for router ARP table analysis.
 Layer 3 traceroute with Layer 2 MAC-level path tracing.
 .
 Features:
  - Traditional ICMP-based traceroute functionality
  - Layer 2 MAC address resolution via ARP
  - Smart mode for querying router ARP tables
  - Broadcast ARP support
  - Debug mode for detailed packet analysis
  - Detection of invalid and missing routes
 .
 The tool requires either root privileges or CAP_NET_RAW capability.
